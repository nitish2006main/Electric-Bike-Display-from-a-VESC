# Electric-Bike-Display-from-a-VESC
This repository is meant to be for an electric bike project. Specifically, the code for displaying VESC telemetry data on a ST7796 TFT Touchscreen Display. Using VescUart, we were able to extract data from the VESC such as RPM, and calculate other data like battery and distance, through UART serial communication between the ST7796 and VESC. After assembling the VESC with proper wiring, once we hit the throttle, the display automatically updates values for each of those features. As a firmware team of 5, we all did research for the perfect VESC and display, wired the VESC appropriately to the display, extracted data from the VESC, formatted the display, made calculations for the pre-existing data, to finally have the entire firmware setup to work.
